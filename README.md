A repository where you can get all the code that is on the game "Programming in ROBLOX!" (Link at the end of this file)

Coming from DataStores to even guns and etc, all coded externally and controlled via GitHub. (Rojo, Atom and GitHub are the tools used)

Thanks for coming here and I hope this help you, remember I'm not the best programmer but if it helps you then we're good right? Althought I'm giving my 100% to strictly make the code efficient for your better understanding.

Have a nice day.
